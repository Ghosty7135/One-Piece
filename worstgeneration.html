                The <strong style="color: var(--gold);">Worst Generation</strong> is a notorious group of twelve pirates
                who rose to infamy around the same era. Eleven of them, known as the <em>Supernovas</em>, arrived
                simultaneously at the Sabaody Archipelago — a lawless port before the Grand Line's final leg — each
                carrying bounties of over 100,000,000 Berries. The twelfth, Marshall D. Teach (Blackbeard), was added
                later. Their actions following the Summit War of Marineford — defeating two Emperors, dissolving entire
                crews, and reshaping the New World's power balance — have branded them as the most dangerous generation
                of pirates in history.
